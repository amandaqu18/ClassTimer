# What our project does

For this project a GUI-based application was created for the students of Quinnipiac University. This application is a class timer which allows students to set a timer in accordance to their class timings. Five options with the various class durations are given. Once an option is clicked the timer starts and a blue progress bar starts and expands. Once the bar has reached the end of the canvas width the student knows that the class is/should be over.
